In this assignment, you must do the following:
Construct a class with a basic array of numbers (the composition class).
The class must be configurable with a strategy for sorting the list (the compositor
class).
Implement at least three different sorting algorithms, e.g. QuickSort, MergeSort,
BubbleSort etc., that can be used as a strategy.
You can easilly find implementations of these algorithms (and other sorting algorithms)
on the Internet, but you must fit them to work with your strategy.
