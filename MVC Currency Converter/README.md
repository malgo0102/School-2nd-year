Create a currency converter app using Model View Controller and Delegate patterns.
You must make class diagrams and other relevant documentation, and a dummy
implementation (which means it should not actually draw the UI).
Use the user interface concepts Models.Window, Models.InputField, Models.Label, DropDownSelection,
and Models.Button.
The user picks a currency and inputs an amount, and the app should convert the
amount into the chosen currency.
The app should also feature an Models.About button, that opens a new window with
information about your app. The Models.About window should have an OK button to close
the window.
All the user interface components must have toString() command to print out all
parent and child elements, and other relevant configuration.
Make sure objects are connected correctly.
